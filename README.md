# w4111-proj1
Web front-end project of database course in Python, Flask and HTML

We implemented the functionalities from original proposal including listing recommended books for each user, allowing user to like/dislike/rate book, like/dislike type, write/delete comments, and searching books with book title or author name. In addition, we added the homepage for a user to jump to specific functionalities including checking liked book and liked types lists.
We didn't implement the manager feauture because we think the functionalities for manager are mostly duplicated except for deleting users.
